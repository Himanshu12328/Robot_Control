# Robot Control

This repository contains code for different robot control systems. Each folder contains code, simulations and documentation for a specific robot control system.
## Folders
### Robust Control of the RRBot Robotic Arm

This folder contains code for implementing robust control of the RRBot robotic arm. The RRBot robotic arm is a two-link planar robotic arm. The folder contains MATLAB code for designing a robust controller for the robot, simulations of the controller, and documentation on the control system.

### Robust Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotor UAVs using Sliding Mode Control

This folder contains code for implementing robust trajectory tracking for quadrotor UAVs using sliding mode control. The folder contains MATLAB code for designing a sliding mode controller for the quadrotor UAV, simulations of the controller, and documentation on the control system.

### Trajectory generation and Feedback Linearization Control for the RRBot Robotic Arm

This folder contains code for trajectory generation and feedback linearization control of the RRBot robotic arm. The folder contains MATLAB code for generating trajectories for the robot and designing a feedback linearization controller for the robot, simulations of the controller, and documentation on the control system.
